#Random String Generator Documentation
Overview
This Python script generates a random string of characters consisting of digits, letters (both uppercase and lowercase), and punctuation marks.

Usage
The script utilizes the random and string modules from the Python Standard Library.

Import Modules
random: Provides functions for generating random numbers.
string: Contains a collection of string constants representing ASCII characters of different types.

The script iterates 12 times to create a string of length 12.
In each iteration, it randomly selects a character from one of the following sources:
Digits (0-9)
Letters (both uppercase and lowercase)
Punctuation marks
The selected characters are appended to a list.
python


The generated characters are joined together to form a single string.
This string is then printed to the console.

Deoendancies
Python 3.x
Standard Library Modules: random, string
Notes
This script provides a simple method for generating random strings with a mix of alphanumeric characters and punctuation marks.
Adjusting the length of the generated string can be done by modifying the range in the loop (e.g., changing range(12) to range(16) for a 16-character string).
The script does not include whitespace characters in the generated string.
